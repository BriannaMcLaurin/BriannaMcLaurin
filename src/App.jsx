      <Section title="About Me">
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a senior at Glasgow High School, and Iâ€™m passionate
          about building creative and impactful technology. Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve worked
          as a paid intern at Code Differently, partipating in full-stack development teams and gaining
          experience with React, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I also completed a paid summer internship
          at J.P. Morgan Chase, where I strengthened my Java skills and worked in a scrum team to contribute 
          to a internal use JPMC application. <br /><br />
          Iâ€™ve earned recognition including the NCWIT Delaware Award and top placements at Delaware's
          BPA States. Iâ€™m excited to pursue a computer science degree and eventually become a
          software architect, building systems that make a difference in peopleâ€™s everyday lives.

          <h3>Emoji Duel</h3>
          <p>
            A real-time multiplayer emoji guessing game built with React and Socket.io. Players
            compete to identify emojis as quickly as possible in timed rounds. I built the frontend
            interface, integrated Firebase Database, and polished the UI for mobile.

          <p>
           This is a project I made during my time at Code Differently. 
           It is a wordle game with a twist. Just like regular wordle, you have to guess the word in 6 tries. But, in this game, after 3 attepmts you get a hint. 
           The hint is the defintion of the word.
