      <Section title="About Me">
        <p>
          Iâ€™m a senior at Sarah Pyle Academy enrolled in the Twilight Program, and Iâ€™m passionate
          about building creative and impactful technology. Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve worked
          as a paid intern at Code Differently, leading frontend development teams and gaining
          experience with React, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I also completed a summer internship
          at J.P. Morgan Chase, where I strengthened my Java skills and learned how large-scale
          systems operate. <br /><br />
          Iâ€™ve earned recognition including the NCWIT Delaware Award and top placements at Delaware
          BPA States. Iâ€™m excited to pursue a computer science degree and eventually become a
          software architect, building systems that make a difference in peopleâ€™s everyday lives.

            A real-time multiplayer emoji guessing game built with React and Socket.io. Players

          <p>
            During my two-year internship at Code Differently, I worked on full-stack applications
            as part of agile teams. I led a small group of interns, built responsive React interfaces,
            and integrated them with Java Spring Boot and MySQL backends.
